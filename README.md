## Settings

You should download trained shape predictor file from [here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) or could trian it by yourself. Unzip it, rename it to sp68.dat and put in dir [assets](https://github.com/oleg-sta/Masks/tree/master/assets). This file is very large so I don't store on version control. Yes, it's bad, but I made simple bad solution.
Make settings to submodule [commonLib](https://github.com/oleg-sta/commonLibMask).
